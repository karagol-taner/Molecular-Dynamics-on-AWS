# Molecular Dynamics on AWS

Molecular Dynamics on AWS (Amazon Web Services)

## Introduction
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful computational tool used in various fields of science, including chemistry, biology, and materials science. GROMACS is a widely used open-source molecular dynamics simulation software designed for biochemical molecules.

While many researchers have access to High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities for conducting simulations, some freelance scientists or researchers in middle-income countries may not have access to such resources due to cost or infrastructure limitations. This repository demonstrates how to leverage AWS cloud computing resources to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations, enabling researchers to tackle larger and more complex systems while optimizing costs and scalability. 

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide a framework for setting up and running molecular dynamics simulations on AWS.
