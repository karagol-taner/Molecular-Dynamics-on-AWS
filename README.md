# Molecular Dynamics on Cloud Computing

Molecular Dynamics on Google Compute Engine, AWS (Amazon Web Services), and other Cloud Computing services

## Overview
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful computational tool used in various fields of science, including chemistry, biology, and materials science. GROMACS is a widely used open-source molecular dynamics simulation software designed for biochemical molecules.

While many researchers have access to High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities for conducting simulations, some freelance scientists or researchers in middle-income countries may not have access to such resources due to cost or infrastructure limitations. Traditionally, High-Performance Computing (HPC) has involved on-premises infrastructure, with organizations investing in supercomputers or computer clusters. However, over the last decade, computing resources provided by commercial providers have gained popularity, offering flexible solutions regardless of investment capabilities. Platforms like Google Compute Engine and AWS provide scalable computing infrastructure, allowing researchers to leverage cloud resources for their simulations. This repository demonstrates how to use compute engine resources like AWS cloud computing and Google Compute Engine to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations, enabling researchers to tackle larger and more complex systems while optimizing costs and scalability.
